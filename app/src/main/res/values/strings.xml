    <string name="description">This app demonstrates possibility to override some system keys behaviour
        (home, power button) without having appropriate permission. On official release ZNH0EAO2NM it allows
        to bypass android.permission.PREVENT_POWER_KEY permission which allows to override power button
        behaviour. On latest nighties where above permission is changed to android.permission.PREVENT_SYSTEM_KEYS
        it also allows to override behaviour of home button and possibly menu. Since that permission
        has signature|privileged protection level this seems like serious security vulnerability.</string>
